AbsyntaxExcelAddIn
==================

Introduction
------------

The universal add-in for Microsoft Excel.  Invoke operations that you define using the Absyntax framework.


Synopsis
--------

The Absyntax Excel Add-in for Microsoft Excel integrates Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software and the Absyntax framework. The add-in may be considered a universal add-in to the extent that it allows a Microsoft Excel user to invoke multiple user-defined operations, typically on ranges of data in Microsoft Excel worksheets. In this context, "user-defined operation" is a synonym for an Absyntax project.
